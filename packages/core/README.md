# HTML Polygon Core

HTML Polygon is a polygon element generator for the following web frameworks:

* [React](https://github.com/html-polygon/html-polygon/tree/main/packages/react)
* [Vue 3](https://github.com/html-polygon/html-polygon/tree/main/packages/vue)

This is the core package used by the framework specific packages, so you
probably want to install one of those, not this.
