# HTML Polygon

HTML Polygon is a polygon element generator for ReactJS.

## Why?

There are lots of polygon building utilities out there. They all generate
either embedded SVGs, or they use CSS clip paths to clip the shape of standard
divs.

The thing they all have in common is their inability to reliably contain text
that "flows" into the shape to fill the polygon.

This is where HTML Polygon differs. This component builds an HTML element that
both looks like a polygon, and behaves like a polygon.
